I'm experimenting with the Distill package in R for creating a personal blog. I'm in the process of converting the old blog into this new format. Thank you for your patience. The name of this blog is a tool to help pronounce my last name. Bruere is pronounced brew air, so I tell people I brew air, not beer. Hope this helps anyone trying to pronounce my last name!
